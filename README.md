# Linear-Regression---GPA-Predictor
A linear regression model for predicting GPA from scores. It is an implementation of the linear regression formaula involving the manipulation of matrices.

**gpa_generator** generates a uniform random distribution scores alongside their corresponding GPAs. It is used to generate **gpa_train_x_scores** where 'x' represents the dataset length. Also a test dataset, **gpa_test_score** is used to compare the accuracy of various datasets.

In **gpa_linear_regression** theta values
